        <h2>THE NEXT CONSOLE</h2>
        <p>I strongly think that the next Nintendo console will be some sort of successor to the Switch. It was just too successful to pass up on making an amped-up version of one. You could argue that they tried the same thing with the Wii U, but I think that they've learned from their mistakes and won't name it anything stupid this time. Even something simple like the Switch 2 would still indicate that it's a different console than the original. Since the Switch would still be continuing, I don't expect there to be a new handheld anytime soon, as the Switch itself works as one. I also think that the next console will have 4K graphics, no doubt. One of the most major things holding Nintendo back compared to its competitors is their lack of processing power, so finally having a 4K Switch console would be great. Having the new Switch be fully backwards compatable with all of the games from the original Switch would also be great.</p>

        <h2>EXPANDING HORIZONS</h2>

        <p>In the last few years, Nintendo has been diving into different ventures, much like they used to do in the past. As a prominent example, The Super Mario Bros Movie was released last year, and became the second highest grossing animated film of all time, only behind Frozen 2. The movie was loaded with a bunch of not just Mario references, but also to a bunch of Nintendo's other series. Nintendo has confirmed that more movies are in production, such as a Legend Of Zelda movie, and two sequels to the Mario movie, which makes a lot of sense seeing how successful the Mario movie was.</p>

        <p>Nintendo is now also the owner of a theme park called "Super Nintendo World", and is in a select few locations, such as Japan and Hollywood, as well as future plans to open in Orlando and Signapore. Much like the Maio movie, the theme park is packed with a lot of references, mostly Mario, as well as several attractions, such as a Mario Kart ride where you actually get to go behind the wheel. There are also several character cameos at the park, such as Mario, Luigi, Peach and Toad. If you'd like to experience all the fun, you can get special power-up bands, designed like your favorite Mario characters, to be able to interact with morethings around the theme park, as well as complete missions on your phone. It's a really cool gimmick which I would definitely recommend getting if you can afford it.</p>
