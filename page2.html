        <h2>HUMBLE BEGINNINGS</h2>

        <p>Nintendo didn't actually start as a video game company in the 1980's. They actually started as a card company in the 1880's. Founded by Fusajiro Yamauchi in 1889 and located in Kyoto, Japan, the original purpose of Nintendo was to produce and sell "Hanafuda Cards", which are a popular type of playing card in Japan. They actually got so popular, that they even became the top distributor of these cards, even earning the liscencing to use other characters on their cards. Nintendo would continue solely creating Hanafuda Cards until the mid 1960's, where they decided to venture out into different areas. As a prominent example, Nintendo attempted to dive into the food market by making rice, however it didn't prove to be too successful, as there were other rice distributors around who did it better. One venture which did prove to be successful was that into the toy industry, with toys such as the Ultra Hand and Love Tester being instant hits. Nintendo still wanted to venture out even more, however, into something more modern and technological for the time.</p>

        <h2>ENTERING THE VIDEO GAME MARKET</h2>
        <p>In the mid 1970's, Nintendo released their first pair of video game consoles, "Color TV-Game 6" and "Color TV-Game 15", to some success. Nintendo wouldn't become a household name, however, until 1981, with the release of the hit arcade game "Donkey Kong", designed by Shigeru Miyamoto. This game left Nintendo's mark on the video game industry, solidifying their position as one of the best in the world. Nintendo continued to make arcade games, including sequels to the original Donkey Kong, however the arcade industry couldn't last forever.</p>

        </section>
        <p>Around 1983, the entire industry suffered from the Video Game Crash. Arcades were making next to no profit and it seemed like video games were a short lived industry. Nintendo, seeing how much money Donkey Kong brought in, didn't want gaming to die out, because then they'd have to resort to the less profitable toy industry. So, in 1985, Nintendo released the Nintendo Entertainment System, also simply called the NES, along with the hit game "Super Mario Bros". Despite the ongoing crash, both the NES and Super Mario Bros sold shockingly well, with the console selling around 60 million units, and Super Mario Bros selling about 40 million. These two products would singlehandedly revive the video game industry and get people back into video games once more. It's highly likely that without the NES, video games wouldn't be where they are today!</p>

        <h2>INNOVATING THE INDUSTRY</h2>
        <p>After the release of the NES, things were going really well for Nintendo. They were starting some of their most popular franchises, such as The Legend Of Zelda, Metroid, and the aforementioned Mario, and their success persisted into the early 90's with the release of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, or just SNES for short, just shy of 50 million units sold, as well as the release of their first ever handheld system, the Game Boy, in 1989, which spawned a whole collection of Game Boy systems, such as the Game Boy Color and the Game Boy Advance. In total, all the Game Boy consoles sold approximately 120 million consoles, definitely proving to be a success. Entering the late 90's, Nintendo knew they had to change it up a little, as doing the same thing over and over again is bound to get stale; therefore, in 1996, Nintendo released the Nintendo 64 (or N64 for short). The console's main selling point was that it utilized fully 3D technology. Being the first console to implement 3D, this paved the way for all future systems. Shockingly, despite this, the Nintendo 64 sold less than both the NES and the SNES, at just over 30 million units.</p>

        </section>
        <p>Entering the early 2000s, Nintendo introduced the Gamecube, which was virtually an amped up Nintendo 64, but now used disks, which allowed for more game space, and was easier to carry around. As such, it sold even less than the N64 did, with just over 20 million consoles sold. With every proceeding console doing worse in terms of sales, Nintendo knew that if they didn't make a change quickly, they'd soon be out of the video game market; therefore, in 2006, they released the Nintendo Wii. The Wii's main gimmick was that it utilized motion controls thanks to it's new, unique controller, the Wii Remote. As such, it appealed to a more casual audience, including people who wouldn't normally enjoy video games. This decision ended up paying off big time, as the Wii would go to sell over 100 million consoles. Around the same time, Nintendo also released the Nintendo DS, their next portable system in the lineup, moving away from the whole Game Boy brand. The DS stood for Dual Screens, which is because the DS had one screen at the top, and one at the bottom. The bottom screen was also utilized as a touch screen. The DS ended up selling over 150 million units, being Nintendo's best selling console. The DS, along with it's successor, the Nintendo 3DS, which incorporated 3D into a lot of games, sold about 225 million consoles all together.</p>

        <h2>MODERN ERA</h2>
        <p>After the massive success of the Wii, Nintendo attempted to continue the hype train of the Wii and motion controls by creating the Wii U. The Wii U introduced the Gamepad, a controller that basically functioned like the bottom screen of a DS. It had touch screen functionality, and oftentimes showed something different than what was going on on the TV. There were a few problems with this system, however. For one, a lot of games forced you to constantly switch between the Gamepad and the TV, which is just generally bad game design. The second, and way more prominent issue, was the terrible marketing campaign. Nintendo essentially solely advertised the Gamepad and nothing else, leaving everyone to believe that the Wii U was just an add-on to the Wii. The name being Wii U didn't help matters either. Both of these factors led to the Wii U selling a measly 13 million units, being Nintendo's lowest selling home console.</p>

        <p>Considering how hard the Wii U flopped, Nintendo needed to bounce back. What better way to attempt a revival than to experiment with a new innovative idea again and see if it would be well received so, that's what they did. Their next, and final, console up to this point is the Nintendo Switch. The Switch's main claim to fame was that it combined being able to play on the TV, and on the go. If you were at home, then you could put the Switch into the dock, and it would connect to the TV. If you wanted to bring it outside, all you had to do was take the Switch out of the dock, and bam, a portable system! It also had special controllers called Joy-Cons. These controllers still retained the motion controls that the Wii Remotes had, while also coming in a variety of different colors, so you could mix and match to see which combination you like the best. The Switch isn't perfect, however. It still lacked in hardware capabilities compared to it's competitors, as it still used the same processing power that the Wii U did, but most people just chose to accept it in exchange for the ability to be able to play some of their favorite games on the go. Another big issue with the Nintendo Switch doesn't have much to do with the system, but more with it's controllers. The Joy-Cons are infamous for drifting. This means that the sticks will move on their own, without any player input. It got so bad, to the point where Nintendo themselves started offering free Joy-Con repairs for anyone whose controllers were drifting; however, the positives outweighed the negatives. As such, the Switch, as of right now, is sitting at around 115 million consoles sold, even beating out the Wii. As it stands, who knows how much more popular it'll get, and if a potential successor will overpass it.</p>
