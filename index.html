                    <p>ABOUT ME</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I've been a big fan of Nintendo since I was 5, so I'd say that I know a fair share of things about this company. It has been my video game company of choice for all these years, and I don't think it'll change anytime soon. I play video games daily, and I play a whole lot of Nintendo games, so I felt like making a website about Nintendo just fit.</p>
